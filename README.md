# Confirmation Bias Study - Paper Code

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a study investigating confirmation bias across three belief contexts: scientific, cultural, and paranormal. The study examines belief change through a text-based intervention and a simulated web search task.

## Research Context
The study focuses on three belief categories:
1. **Scientific Beliefs** - Evaluated through the health risks and benefits of genetically modified (GM) food.
2. **Cultural Beliefs** - Examined via the concept of the evil eye.
3. **Paranormal Beliefs** - Addressed through the existence of UFOs on Earth.

Participants engaged in a controlled, offline computer-based task designed to measure how they interact with supportive and contradictory evidence in different belief domains.

## Study Design
The study employed a within-subjects experimental design with the following five sequential phases for each belief category:
1. **Topic Definition** - Participants were introduced to the topic with neutral background information.
2. **Pre-Intervention Belief Assessment** - Initial beliefs were measured using a visual analog scale ranging from -50 to +50.
3. **Intervention Phase** - Participants read 30 short, AI-generated text statements (15 supporting and 15 opposing their belief) presented in a randomized order.
4. **Simulated Online Search Task** - Participants conducted searches in a simulated online environment modeled after real news websites, with search results categorized as supportive or opposing.
5. **Post-Intervention Questionnaire** - Participantsâ€™ beliefs were reassessed to measure changes after exposure to varied information.

## Code Details
The study was implemented using **HTML** and **JavaScript** to create an interactive simulated web environment. The key components include:
- A structured intervention phase presenting randomized statements.
- A simulated web search environment mimicking real-world search engines.
- A controlled system to monitor participants' search behavior (time spent, pages visited, etc.).

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/confirmation-bias-study.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to interact with the study simulation.
3. The JavaScript files control text presentation, randomized search results, and user interactions.

## Future Improvements
- Expanding the study to additional belief categories.
- Enhancing the search environment with more features.
- Improving the number of data .
